# Flattening Docker images

Docker inherently uses a layered filesystem, and we have already discussed why it is necessary and how it is beneficial in depth. However, in some particular use cases, Docker practitioners have observed that a Docker image with fewer layers performs better. You can reduce layers in an image by flattening it. However, it is still not a best practice, and you need to do this only if you see a performance improvement, as this would result in a filesystem overhead.

Filesystem overhead is the storage space consumed by the filesystemâ€™s internal data structures, such as file tables, inodes, and journals.
