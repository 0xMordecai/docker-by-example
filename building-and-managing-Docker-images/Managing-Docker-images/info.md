# Managing Docker images

In modern DevOps practices, Docker images are primarily built either on a developer machine or a
CI/CD pipeline. The images are stored in a container registry and then deployed to multiple staging
environments and production machines. They might run Docker or a container orchestrator, such
as Kubernetes, on top of them.
