# Multi-stage builds

Letâ€™s modify the Dockerfile according to the **multi-stage** build process and see what we get.

The following is the `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.22.2 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
COPY app.go .
RUN go mod tidy
RUN GO111MODULE=off GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app . && chmod +x ./app


FROM alpine:3.18.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
CMD ["./app"]
```

The Dockerfile contains two **FROM** directives: `FROM golang:1.22.2 AS build` and `FROM alpine:3.18.0`. The first **FROM** directive also includes an **AS** directive that declares the stage and names it build. Anything we do after this **FROM** directive can be accessed using the build term until we encounter another **FROM** directive, which would form the second stage. Since the second stage is the one we want to run our image from, we are not using an **AS** directive.
