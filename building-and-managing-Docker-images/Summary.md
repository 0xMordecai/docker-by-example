# Summary
In this chapter, we have covered a lot of ground. At this point, you should understand Docker from a 
hands-on perspective. We started with Docker images, how to use a Dockerfile to build Docker images, 
the components and directives of the Dockerfile, and how to create efficient images by following some 
best practices. We also discussed flattening Docker images and improving container security using 
distroless images. Finally, we discussed Docker registries, how to run a private Docker registry on a 
Docker server, and how to use other turnkey solutions, such as Sonatype Nexus and JFrog Artifactory.
