# Understanding Docker registries

A **`Docker registry` is a stateless, highly scalable server-side application that stores and lets you distribute `Docker images`**. The registry is open source under the permissive Apache license. **It is a storage and distribution system where all your Docker servers can connect and upload and download images when needed**. It acts as a distribution site for your images.
