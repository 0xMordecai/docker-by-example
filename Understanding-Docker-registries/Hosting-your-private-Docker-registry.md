# Hosting your private Docker registry

**Docker provides an image that you can run on any server that has Docker installed. Once the container is up and running, you can use that as the `Docker registry`**. Letâ€™s have a look:
```shell
    docker run -d -p 80:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
    Unable to find image 'registry:2' locally
