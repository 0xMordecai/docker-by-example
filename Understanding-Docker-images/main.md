# Understanding Docker images

Docker images form the blueprint of Docker containers.a Docker image specifies what packages,source code, dependencies, and libraries it needs to use. It also determines what it needs to do for the source code to run effectively.

Technically, it consists of a series of steps you would perform on a base OS image to get your application up and running. This may include installing packages and dependencies, copying the source code to the correct folder, building your code to generate a binary, and so on.
