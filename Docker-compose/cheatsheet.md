# Declarative container management with Docker Compose

Docker Compose helps you manage multiple containers in a declarative way. You can create a YAML file and specify what you want to build, what containers you want to run, and how the containers interact with each other. You can define mounts, networks, port mapping, and many different configurations in the YAML file.
